# Setting Up The Mini Keyboard

This part of the project began with a little investigation: what key codes does it actually send?

The product listing on aliexpress claimed the keyboard would come with software for remapping keys, but there was literally nothing in the box but the keyboard and a cable. No manual, no piece of paper with a urlâ€”hell, I didn't even a brand name to google.

So. I plugged the keyboard into my laptop, ran `cat -v` in a terminal, and started fiddling. And lo: _literally everything_ sent the letter `c`. The 6 keys? Every one a `c`. Turn the knob clockwise, it sends one `c` per tick. Counterclockwise? More `c`s. Press the knob? You guessed it. While I kinda respected this heinous default's commitment to the bit, it was unusable: I had to replace the firmware to get a useful set of keycodes.

I searched all over the web for the keyboard by description, with and without `aliexpress` appended to the search, but all I found were old forum posts with broken links and rumors of a malware-ridden, windows-only keyboard mapper provided by the company that I could maybe run in a VM. 

I got fed up before I found a copy, so I opened up the case, wrote down what I saw on the circuit board, and searched for that instead. That was a much better idea; I soon found [`ch57x-keyboard-tool`](https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool), a rust project for doing exactly what I needed to do, supporting hardware suspiciously similar to mine.

## defining a new layout for the keyboard
Here's the keyboard layout I used. There were 2 rows of 3 keys each, and every key needed a job. On the bottom row were three keys to toggle whether specific other speakers were grouped with the line in; on top was one to connect the line in audio source, and... two more. Better to have and not need, I guess? Those got the "forward track" and "backward track" actions, in case I'm streaming digital tracks on a group of sonos speakers that includes the line in. Turning the knob should change volume, of course; pressing it should toggle mute. Nothing fancy like RGB lighting[^5].

[^5]: RGB lighting _is_ technically a feature of this keyboard, and I started out with hopes of lighting up specific keys to show which speakers were connected. I thought it would useful and rad, and I still do. But the only controls available were some predefined full-keyboard light patterns which could only be triggered en masse, not on a per-key basis, and only by an external signal from the computer it's plugged into. So it goes.

Each "job" is mapped to a mnemonic letter key, even media functions that have dedicated keycodes:
- back row of keyboard buttons
  - [**b**]ackwards track
  - toggle [**p**]honograph as input source
  - [**f**]orwards track
- front row of keyboard buttons
  - toggle [**t**]v speaker
  - toggle [**l**]iving room speaker
  - toggle [**k**]itchen speaker
- the rotary knob has 3 triggers
  - turning clockwise (`cw`) -> [**u**]p
  - turning counterclockwise (`ccw`) -> [**d**]own
  - `press` -> toggle [**m**]ute

```yaml
#  buttons on the left, knobs on the right
orientation: normal

rows: 2
columns: 3
knobs: 1

layers:
  - buttons:
      - ["b", "p", "f"]
      - ["t", "l", "k"]
    knobs:
      - ccw: "d"
        press: "m"
        cw: "u"
```

Installing was straightforward and well-documented; check out 

The keyboard chip supports multiple layers, but there's no way to switch them without a preinstalled physical toggle, and my keyboard had none; I didn't bother with multiple `layers` entries. I did mourn the lack of QMK-style "send a keycode when tapping a given key, but act as a modifier when held" functionality: I would love to be able to make it so that holding some speaker's toggle key would let me temporarily manage the group members and volume of _its_ group, but node per se doesn't distinguish between keyup and keydown events, so without firmware support, I can't do anything that fancy without a grip of additional setup; this one had to stay on the cutting room floor.
