# Projects of mine

When deciding whether to write a public description of a project, I prefer to err on the
side of professional discretion; I don't write about software projects if I can't freely
include its source code, which means you can expect this list to skew heavily towards
personal side projects. Some are large and complex; some are small and direct. I hope you
enjoy reading them; if anything is unclear or particularly interesting, please do drop a
question in the comments.
