====================

My personal site! Hullo!

### Table of Contents (of the site, not the README)
* A front page! This is a "get hired" page.
  - It lists a few projects (WHOO those do not, at the time of this writing,
  altogether reflect my current skill level)
  - It has a picture of me!
  - It has a cool little sierpinski triangle doodad!
  (On scroll or devicemove it populates a sierpinski triangle via the
  [Chaos Game](sdf))
