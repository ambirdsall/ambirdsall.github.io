<p>Our wedding photographer was a little slow in getting us our images, so I got
to thinking about what to do. I decided I wanted a static image gallery, and I
wanted it to be easy for anyone who came to get copies of photos they like,
whether for online use or making prints. For prints, people should be able to
download the high-resolution originals, and those are such big files, it makes
sense to zip the files before downloading. For digital use, there should be
smaller image files for download<span class="sidenote__mark">*</span><span class="sidenote">I whipped up some <code>imagemagick</code> scripts to do batch resizing and optimizing, and hosted all the photos as public-read files in an s3 bucket</span>
,
but that could easily be handled entirely client-side.</p>

<p>I decided that, in addition to normal &ldquo;download this photo&rdquo; usage, I wanted the
ability to</p>

<ol>
<li>Select any given subset of the images easily; and</li>
<li>Download that set of images as a zip file</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a kinda fun UI problem AND has a fun backend problem despite dealing
with static data. Which is great: since we&rsquo;re not barring our photos from
anyone, there&rsquo;s no need to implement any auth, which simplifies things.</p>

<p>The zipping part means there needs to be some server code running; I decided to use
a rails app hosted on elastic beanstalk. I was already hosting the images on
s3, and AWS designs all their services for easy interop (naturally, to keep all
your money going their way); besides, I had never hosted an app that way and I
wanted to learn.</p>

<p>Admittedly, for the initial version of this gallery, rails was overkill: just
within the world of ruby development, Sinatra would be plenty for just an image
gallery and a single zipping endpoint. But server-side overkill isn&rsquo;t
necessarily bad: as lost as it&rsquo;s fast and I don&rsquo;t mind paying for it (let&rsquo;s be
real, my family photos aren&rsquo;t going to get millions of distinct views any day
soon), there&rsquo;s no real downside<span class="sidenote__mark">*</span><span class="sidenote">Certainly nothing compared to sites
that make you download megabytes of javascript before the first paint on
mobile</span>
. Besides:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have notions of extending the app with the ability to search and filter by
name, and rails makes building out the additional models down the line quite
straightforward; and</li>
<li>I wanted to practice working in and testing rails code for professional reasons</li>
</ol>

<p>So fuck it, rails it is.</p>

<p>I searched for &ldquo;zip&rdquo; on <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/search?q=zip">Ruby
Toolbox</a>, and found two projects
that seemed to actually be intended for zipping files:</p>

<p><img src="/images/rubyzip-gem-stats.png" class="post-img" alt="Rubyzip gem stats" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/zip-gem-stats.png" class="post-img" alt="Zip gem stats" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how a popularity rating is calculated, but it has a Science Beaker
icon, so it must be important. <a href="https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip">Rubyzip</a>,
it seems, is the gem for me.</p>

<p><h3 id="zip-it-up">
  Zip it up.
  <a class="section__title" href="#zip-it-up">ยง</a>
</h2></p>

<p>That repo&rsquo;s <code>README.md</code> has some intro-type example code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'rubygems'</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'zip'</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear from the example alone what files do and don&rsquo;t need to already
exist to get this to work. I fiddled around until I got a minimal POC working,
which looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># In the Gemfile, mind, you need</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To work inside a filesystem like this, <code>rubyzip</code> needs a full path to the
source files and the zipfile&rsquo;s directory (that all throws a big error if the
path given to <code>zipfile.add</code> isn&rsquo;t valid); but the <code>zipfile_name</code> doesn&rsquo;t need to
exist yet.</p>

<p>More significantly, that <code>&quot;new_filename_for_streamed_data&quot;</code> business implies
that the filesystem can be skipped altogether for data which can be
streamedโfrom a database, say, <a href="https://github.com/ambirdsall/wedding_photos/blob/383ddcb249c657bfbf944533373d7d560cea11ab/app/actors/photo_fetcher.rb#L12-L16">or s3</a>.</p>

<p>This is plenty to work with: just get a list of selected images from the UI;
use that list to generate the corresponding s3 URLs; and then stream the
contents of each photo into a zipfile which is then sent to the user&rsquo;s browser
for download. The <code>zipfile.get_output_stream</code> trick can be used for a friendly
index.txt file down the line, after I&rsquo;ve mapped each photo to the names of the
people in it.</p>
