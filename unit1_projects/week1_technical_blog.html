			<p>I had a hard time picking my three favorite sites. I did a lot of waffling over whether or not a few things even qualified for the purposes of the blog post, and I think some of the things that led me to choose each of the ones I did are contradictory. For example: I chose <a href="www.runofplay.com">The Run of Play</a> for, in large part, its visual simplicity and the clear hierarchy of design, whereas Slate's appeal is in how they present a waterfall of dozens of links and lists and pictures and titles for their various pieces in a deceptively structured way your eye can effortlessly peruse. But I decided that honoring every implicit expectation in the description was less important than just diving into why I like the pages I like.</p>
			
			<p>The Run of Play was, while it lasted, perhaps my favorite site. The homepage gives place of privlege to the latest post, its title written across a huge picture, standing all stark and dramatic astride a grid of the nine preceding posts, each with a short description. A big part of the appeal just boiled down to taste: the pictures were spectacularly well-chosen and evocative, and the writing frequently excellent, flashing highfalutin' academic wordplay, swear-filled, conversational real talk, and a knack for devestatingly apt analogies. When the writing is the focus, the page design should (and does) get the hell out of its way. In the actual posts, the sidebar does yeoman's work: sidenotes sit alongside the main writing, obviating those annoying footnote links that jump you back and forth within the page; large, beautiful pictures are embedded alongside with a subtle icon to let you know you can click to expand; videos are elegantly embedded. All the details are tweaked to avoid any distraction that would interfere or clutter the movement from words, to picture, then more words.</p>
			
			<p>Then there's Flannery. He has a lot of fairly ordinary material on sbnation.com in terms of design; I'm just talking about the weekly feature. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/4/21/5636390/boston-marathon-2014-back-to-the-finish-line">Here's</a> <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/4/6/5586752/nba-season-celebration-sunday-shootaround">some</a> <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/4/1/5567546/doc-rivers-los-angeles-clippers">examples</a> if you're curious. Take, for instance, the way each one uses a series of interstitial fixed-position photos, which are unveiled as the gaps between text blocks scroll through the unmoving photos, the section titles moving in sync with the other words but over the photo. It could have been distracting and ugly, but it's a cool trick and it works beautifully. Other pictures fill the whole width of the text block, which works great for a subject as intensely visual as basketball. The division into sections keeps you scrolling through short, easily-digestible chucks of prose, lists, or whatnot, and each new section rewards your scrolling with one of those low z-index flybys. The sections also allow for a subtle, classy little navigation bar under the title/picture combo, but I've never once felt the urge to use it. Scrolling through it is just sort of viscerally rewarding.</p>

			<p>Slate's homepage, in contrast, looks awfully chaotic from any distance. A serious of boxes, 1/3 to 1/2 of which have pictures as well as titles, which can either be on top of the pictures or under them, fill up the space around the odd sidebar, list, pair of columns or whatnot. With all those small bits of information, I find my eye scanning for topics or titles that grab my interest. This is when their clickbait headlines come into play, of course. They fit various organizing schema amidst the clutter: various kinds of lists, curated grids of almost old news, categories by subject, etc. They mix size and formatting in small ways between these lists, but are consistent within them. All these things speed up my eye's scanning for something I want to read. Even within a page, there's a long, non-hierarchical sidebar of related stories: again, easy and fast to peruse. With all those options in the sidebar of every article, it's easy to "burrow" through the site, going from page to page without going back to the homepage. It can feel a bit addictive after a while, but that type of visual scanning is pretty basic to being human. We're wicked good at it, and up to a point, it's satisfying.</p>

		<div class="sidenote" id="note-one">Specifically, I couldn't decide whether to put in Paul Flannery's Sunday Shootaround blog posts for SB Nation, being just one author's contribution to a larger site.  I also debated including <a href="http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html">If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel</a>, which is just beautiful and tactile and informative and just utterly unlike any other site I know. I won't analyze it, but you should definitely click if you're unfamiliar.</div> 
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-two">It's like a classy book, but with youtube!</div>
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-three">It might be more accurate to say I have a love-hate relationship with Slate. Some of their design methods exploit the ways the human brain is wired, which can feel, well, exploitative.</div>
