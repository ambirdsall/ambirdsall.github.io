		<h1>WHO I AM</h1>
		<p>I'm Alex Birdsall. I'm from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjqfVc7eiA8" target="_blank">Vermont</a>, I live in Portland, OR, and I'm in Dev Bootcamp SF's July 14th cohort. I'm a 28 year-old cismale human<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.
		<h2>WHERE I CAN BE FOUND</h2>
		<p>Depends! Physically, you can find me here: <br/>

		<p>And electronically, you can find me <a href="mailto:ambirdsall@gmail.com">here</a></p>

		<h3>WHAT I LIKE TO DO</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Write music. Except for lyrics: I really, really don't like that part.</li>
			<li>Rock climb! Especially actual rocks, but mostly in bouldering gyms.</li>
			<li>Watch the NBA and sometimes crack jokes on twitter about it. See below.</li>
			<li>Play with dogs; hang out with cats.</li>
			<li>Get from point A to point B and back on a bicycle.</li>
			<li>Lawn sports.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>WHAT I DON'T LIKE TO DO</h4>
		<p>I don't like to bar hop. It brings out my inner old man because <b>why can't those damn kids keep it down I can't hear myself talking WAIT WHY ARE WE LEAVING ALREADY WHERE DID ALL MY MONEY GO</b>. I don't like to watch a lot of TV, which is too bad, because the world is full of very good programs I can't be bothered to watch. I don't like to interrupt people. And although I love being the second or third person on the dance floor, I don't like being the first.</p>

		<h6>Footnotes:</h6>
		<p><a name="fn1">1:</a> Quick digression: I've always been conflicted about the cis* identifier. Calling myself "cismale" can serve as a shoutout to the diversity of gender experiences and presentations; on the other hand, how do you avoid the term coming off as some overeducated liberal "YO I AIN'T NO TRANNY"? Guess if I were <i>really</i> interested in efficient problem-solving I'd have just called myself "male" and been done with it.
