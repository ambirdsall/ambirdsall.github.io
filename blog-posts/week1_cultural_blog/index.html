			<p>For 12 years, I was involved every summer with a camp back east, first as a kid and then as a counselor. Camp Lanakila is run by an extraordinarily emotionally intelligent guy who has really pushed the whole enterprise, programmatically, towards a model where empathy, hard work, and community are ingrained values. If a kid acted up, we were explicitly trained to figure out what emotional needs were being unmet: no one WANTS to fuck up, but if you're not feeling like you can't be free, or powerful, or playful, or loving, lashing out can be a way to at least change the narrative. "Lanakila" is Hawaiian for "victory", and there was a whole meme about the "Lanakila victory" being a victory over yourself.</p>
			
			<p>Right now, I'm working at an after-school art program. It's not very intellectually challenging, but there's a constant struggle against the sort of "restaurant mentality" that Shereef talked about. Even at second grade, kids have sort of sophisticated, if inarticulate, ideas about expectations and plagiarism and working the system that we have to push against. We're trying to get them to make things that they really take control of, something exciting and idiosyncratic, whatever direction that might take them. So, through some accidents of history, I feel right at home with the philosophy Dev Bootcamp espouses. The point is to create with the people around you an environment where there's no utility to cynicism. I can talk the talk, and I've experienced walking the walk.</p>
			
			<p>That said, I'm also crazy worried. I know I can hit the ground running, culturally, but can I maintain that? I can remember falling short of being the person I wanted to be while working through the existential angst of my early 20s. There's no reason to expect that to happen again, but I know shortsightedness is a thing I'm capable of. More than that, I haven't worked this hard in a long time. Certain mental muscles have atrophied a little, and I need to work to build up my mental discipline if I'm going to hack it at Dev Bootcamp. That's hard, shitty work, and both success and failure at it are self-reinforcing. My habits have to change, and they have to become more demanding. I have to go uphill.</p> 

			<p>But I  the best times in my life, the times when I've been happiest with who I am, have been the times when I just trust my environment and dive in without making room for worries or contingencies. It's like in rock climbing: if you're afraid you'll fall, your whole body tenses up. You tire out quickly, you gravitate towards a standing position even if that's spacial self-sabotage, and you portion out your effort in a way that makes it impossible to use your full reach, no matter how far the next hold is. If you have to let go of your current hold to move on, your brain is so divided maintaining the "OH GEEZ DON'T FALL OH GOD OH GOD" that it becomes impossible to fully focus and visualize on what you need to do.</p>

			<p>The thing that I think I'll struggle most with is keeping lines of communication open during prep. I'm an introvert with a sort of stubborn streak, and that combination often manifests as a tendency to put my head down and work in my own private space until I'm either done or ready to give up. Only THEN, when it's too late for most kinds of help, do I break radio silence. I'll always be someone who has to think things through on my own first, but I need to dial some of the behaviors that follow from that down a notch. It's a bad habit, and building a new habit over top of it will feel deeply uncomfortable at first. I have faith that I can do better, but it won't feel easy. Easy or not, though, it's vital, because collaboration and communication is fundamental to what Dev Bootcamp is about.</p>

			<p>But enough of that. Bombs away!</p>
