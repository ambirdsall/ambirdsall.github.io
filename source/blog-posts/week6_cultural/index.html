				Stereotype threat is the anxiety that happens when you have to perform in a setting where failure could be taken to be reinforcement for a negative stereotype about part of your identity. The best demonstrated cases in American society, and some of the most pernicious, are women in math and nonwhite/nonasian students in academic settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's something I've only felt intermittently, and in ways that I didn't initially identify when I started reading about stereotype threat. I'm a white man who was raised in a middle-class family to be confident in my own abilities; there are no settings where I have felt the weight of negative stereotypes about any visible aspect of my identity, and so none where I have ever felt the stress of having to perform against unfair expectations. But I felt a small stirring reading about <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/consequences.html">self-handicapping</a>. I recognized a small, rotten voice that I sometimes hear inside of me. Usually, when it pipes up, it's about organizing something, or time management, or boring and stressful long-term responsibilities: all the things that trigger anxiety and self-doubt in relation to ADD.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't want to get carried away with some navel-gazing false equivalence here: after all, ADD is, by definition, a concrete set of behaviors that individuals must personally demonstrate to get diagnosed. This is not the mechanism of a stereotype. But it's a label that carries some specific negative connotations in the public imagination; and it's a label that I carry. These are muddy waters: how much of the self-defeating behaviors I've engaged in through the years can really be attributed to some metadiagnostic anxiety as opposed to the disorder itself? A disorder defined, in part, by self-defeating behavior?
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't know. But the emotional logic is the same, and the way forward seems to be the same as well. Claude Steele's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/?single_page=true">Atlantic article</a> on the subject offers a roadmap of sorts, albeit one restricted to cross-racial academic critiques:
				<blockquote>
					High standards, at least in a relative sense, should be an inherent part of teaching, and critical feedback should be given in the belief that the recipient can reach those standards. These things go without saying for many students. But they have to be made explicit for students under stereotype threat. The good news of this study is that when they aremade explicit, the students trust and respond to criticism.
				</blockquote>
				I'm no professor. But I DID teach swimming to children for 7 years, and I've seen many, many people start flagging after another dive <i>cum</i> bellyflop. Telling them (when it's true! The hopeless ones tend to catch on, for better or worse) that they have the ability to excel with a few concrete improvements is the best way I know of to boster up their motivation and confidence to get through the work of achieving it. That this same basic emotional mechanic can also undercut one of the shittier epiphenomena of our unfair society isn't altogether surprising, but it's heartening.
			</p>
			<p>
				But then, I'm also pretty introverted. It can be hard to always explicitly verbalize that sort of emotional message! And if I don't, I'll just be another socially awkward white guy programmer. A racist and sexist white guy, at that. I'll just put off figuring out how to deal with it until later: I'm terribly busy right now, so I couldn't possibly be expected to have it figured out.

		<div class="sidenote" id="note-one">"Self-handicapping is a defensive strategy by which individuals erect barriers to performance to provide attributions for failure. If barriers indeed undermine performance, individuals can point to the barriers rather than deficiencies in ability or effort."</div>
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-two">According to the last several DSMs, I guess, the term would be "ADHD predominantly inattentive". Still, given my total lack of hyperactivity problem behavior and a commonplace version of the abbreviation that makes no mention of the H, I will go ahead and never use that full acronym.</div> 
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-three">Well, similar, anyway. Don't know of any prescription meds for stereotype threat yet.</div>
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-four">I hope it's clear in context, but let me remove all ambiguity here: this last paragraph is intended as self-deprecating satire. And, I guess, a nod to how pervasive and natural a reaction stereotype threat is. But not at all literally serious.</div>
