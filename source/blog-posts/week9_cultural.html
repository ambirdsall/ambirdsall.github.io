				Asking questions might be the single most important skill for learning to code. Looking up syntax or structural sticking points coherently on Google, looking for help on Stack Overflow, or emailing a friend, there are a few key things all decent questions have in common. If your questions lack any of these, take some time to get your thinking a little straighter. It will pay off.
			</p>
			<p><em><b>Understand What It Is You're Looking For</b></em></p>
			<p>
				This may seem obvious, but it's important. Generalized confusion is really, really hard to articulate in a way that will lead another person to give you useful information. What is the one thing you need to know? What is it's context? Is it language-specific? That sort of thing. If you don't know what you're looking for, it's awfully hard to find.
			</p>
			<p><em><b>Give Context And/Or Examples</b></em></p>
			<p>
				The list of things that can be perfectly understood based solely on a verbal explaination given by someone who is confused and doesn't understand the topic completely is miiiiiiiiiiiiiighty short. Show your work! Letting the experts use their own eyes to find problems is vastly preferable to leaving them in the dark. When in doubt, show more: they'll only bring up the relevent bits in their explanation, and the problem may not be where you expect.
			</p>
			<p>
				If need be, do some experimentation to figure out the scope of your question. Is your function breaking the whole program? Try commenting out sections to figure out the point of error. If that doesn't work, well, that's a useful data point, too.
			</p>
			<p><em><b>Try To Figure Out The Answer On Your Own First</b></em></p>
			<p>
				No shit, right? Still, this is a wicked important step. It helps you clarify the limits of your ignorance, test out some solutions, and learn more about the problem so you can ask a clearer, more informed question. If there are some common solutions to related issues, try them out first! Don't just rely on being able to ask.
