		<h3><a href="http://www.runofplay.com/2011/07/27/reenchanting-the-world/">Run of Play</a></h3>
		<p>I picked the article <a href="http://www.runofplay.com/2011/07/27/reenchanting-the-world/">Reenchanting the World</a>. It's an article typical of their style: spare, white interstitial space, like paper. The main content is in a centered middle column, with large, equal sidebars to either side and an overlapping box on its upper left corner that holds an oversize version of the first letter of the text. In the left sidebar is only a small div with bibliographical information; in the right, various supplementary media. This page has only a small (though, as indicated by a small corner icon, expandible) picture, but this space also holds sidenotes, placed beside the relevent/referent portion of the main text. Borders are almost completely avoided except a few light gray partial borders used as decorative flourishes. The minimalist design, lacking any visual distraction, the centered content box and title, the balanced presentation of nearly bare space and marginalia in the sidebars, all presented to maximally highlight the text. The writing is the site's raison d'etre and its calling card, and it's presented as such.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/4/6/5586752/nba-season-celebration-sunday-shootaround">Sunday Shootaraound</a></h3>
		<p>Paul Flannery's April 6th edition, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/4/6/5586752/nba-season-celebration-sunday-shootaround">A Season Worth Celebrating</a>, is even more typical, being cast in a set weekly format. There is an essay, followed by six recurring sections. Each is introduced by a massive photo, fixed in position underneath the full-width scrolling text box. As you scroll down, the title disappears above the photo while the main text pulls over it like a sheet. Photos after the initial one are revealed as a title, suspended in a gap between text boxes, scrolls up to uncover and then recover the picture. Within the huge text boxes, there are two styles of non-text object: wrapped in text, right-aligned newspaper style pullquotes and a linked list of other Sunday Shootaround pages; and massive photos the same width as the full text. The primacy and visual dynamism of the huge and discoverable pictures really emphasizes the visual focus of the material, and the pullquotes work with the manipulable visuals to give a tactile, newspapery feel. Maybe I'm projecting there, since I know the author is both a working journalist and a professor of Journalism, but the visual dynamism of the page is for real. One of the recurring segments is a list of notable .gifs from the last week of NBA. All the visual stimulus emphasizes the project of the writing, which is trying to articulate the intensely visual experience of watching really good basketball.<p>

		<h3><a href="www.slate.com">Slate's Homepage</a></h3>
		<p>Slate's homepage is absolutely jam-packed with little boxes carrying clickable headlines. Below the three top boxes, carrying an ad, some high-profile articles, and a Slate mug ad (with no title or header whatsoever, this doubles as the only title on the page), it's a pretty sneaky two-column format. The right column is 1/3 of the page, and it's just a massive scrolling list of headlines, authors, articles by Slate's partners, etc. It's a visual anchor to peruse while navigating the left 2/3 of the page. I'm hesitant to even use the word "column", because this space is constantly switching between visual organizations: two boxes, subdivided boxes, double-height boxes, sets of three or four spanning the left 2/3, single giant frames with rotating pictures, etc. It's like the classic experiment where mice hit a bar that intermittently rewards them in self-destructively addictive ways but a consistent one only periodically, except instead of drugs we're getting visual schematics. The eye keeps moving and moving, scanning these shifting patterns and lighting on intriguing headlines. It's actually really hard to avoid clicking on them even studying it for this, which is kind of creeping me out. This project has really made me rethink how I feel about Slate.</p>
