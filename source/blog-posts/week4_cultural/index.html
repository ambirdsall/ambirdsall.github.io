				The lack of diversity in tech is not a new problem, but it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked</a> serious one. Tech professionals are a demographic dominated by men and by whites and asians. Google, for instance, has <a href="http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html">published</a> its own workforce demographics: despite an emphasis on hiring underrepresented demographics, Google is 70% male and fully 91% of its employees are either white or asian (with twice as many whites). Take a minute to play around with <a href="http://money.cnn.com/interactive/technology/tech-diversity-data/">this</a> interactive graph for demographic breakdowns of another five large tech companies: at every single one of the five, the percentage of white men grows successively with the climb in rank from "Professionals" to "Mid-level Officer or Manager" to "Officer or Manager". Most damningly, every one features a top "Officer or Manager" rank that is at least 2/3 white men. While they may not be a representative sample of the industry as a whole, these statistics are a troubling indicator at the very least.
			</p>
			<p>
				And whence the trouble? Well, for one, a homogeneous work environment is less productive and more prone to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a>. While it is hard to quantify, it certainly makes intuitive sense that the relative lack of "outside" perspectives leads to products that are disproportionately inspired by and targeted toward educated white men. And beyond that sort of measurable, it's just flat out unfair.

				A quick aside (brought to you by the color <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/14/summers-comments-on-women-and-science/">crimson</a>): the notion that women are innately worse at quantitative fields is hard to support, given the evidence for culturally mediated performance metrics. As summarized by <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201201/rtx120100010p.pdf">Jonathan M. Kane and Janet E. Mertz</a>:
				<blockquote>
					...boys and girls may be born similar in their innate intellectual potential but end up displaying differences due to a variety of sociocultural factors present in their environment, for example, gender-stratification. If true, one might see differences among countries and changes over time in mathematics variances and mean performances. This gender-stratified hypothesis is consistent with several recent findings. For example, Hyde and collaborators reported that girls have now reched parity with boys in mean mathematics performance in the United States, even in high school, where a significant gap in mean performance existed in the 1970s. Likewise, both Brody and Mills and Wai et al. noted a drop in nonrandom samples of students under thirteen years of age, from 13:1 in the 1970s down to approximately 3:1 by the 1990s in the ratio of U.S. boys to girls scoring above 700 on the quantitative section of the college-entrance SAT examination. The percentage of Ph.D.'s in the mathematical sciences awarded to U.S. citizens who are women has increased from 6 percent in the 1960s to 30 percent in the past decade.
				</blockquote>
				Another, more tech-specific counterexample is Malaysia, whose Information Technology sector "has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark" (h/t to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing#International_perspective">Wikipedia</a>). Acceptance for the parallel concept of racial differences in cognitive ability has, thankfully, fallen out of vogue: I really hope I don't have to engage that shit here.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, what can be done? Unfortunately, there are a lot of factors that are out of our hands as prospective tech professionals: the lack of media examples of nonwhite or female programmers, for instance, or the social pressures for women to self-select away from quantitative fields. There's also the problem of class barriers: programming bootcamps may be shorter and cheaper than traditional colleges, but both require thousands of dollars and an extended period without income. That opportunity cost is just too much for most of the poopulation to bear. A bit of historical context (for instance, Ta-Nehisi Coates' brilliant <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">The Case for Reparations</a>) makes clear how thoroughly this financial hurdle reinforces the paucity of programmers of color. But we have an obligation to do what we can: to attempt to consciously override subconscious biases; to welcome the input of those with different backgrounds; to prioritize diverse hiring practices; and to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a> to help override biases <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/04/02/google-data-mines-its-women-problem/">in promotional practices</a>.

				In other words, we do our damndest.

		<div class="sidenote" id="note-one">Technically, this is untrue: at 157 out of 236, white men only comprise 66.5254% of officers and managers at Ingram Micro, the most diverse of the five. That is a single person shy of a supermajority.</div> 
		<div class="sidenote" id="note-two">Seriously, there are some pretty rough methodological hurdles to clear in accurately, quantifiably defining what constitutes a product "for" a given demographic in all but the most obvious ways.</div>
