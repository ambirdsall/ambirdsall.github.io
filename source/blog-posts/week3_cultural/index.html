				According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">the test</a>, my dominant thinking style is very nearly a tie between Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random. The results, tallied up, claim that Abstract Random has a slight edge over Abstract Sequential; subjectively, I'd give the edge to Abstract Sequential, but however you slice it, it's functionally a tie.
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking through the list of learning preferences for the abstract thinking styles, it's striking how big a divergence there is with regard to group work. I mean, just compare the two: 
			</p>
				<div id="AS">
					Abstract Sequential: <br/>
					<ul>
						<li>his/her point to be heard</li>
						<li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
						<li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="AR">
					Abstract Random:
					<ul>
						<li>to listen to others</li>
						<li>bringing harmony to group situations</li>
						<li>establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
						<li>focusing on the issues at hand</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			<p>
				Random's a total team player, while Sequential's kind of ambivalent. Here, I identify a bit more with the sequential characteristics. I like a logical plan of attack, and I like sometimes to just put my head down and figure things out for myself. And I definitely dislike having my suggestions ignored. But I also enjoy working in a group, and when I am, respect and listening are just inherent to the process. Blowing off my partner's work or suggestions feels totally unnatural to me: if I dislike the contribution, I try to clearly and respectfully explain why I think we should do something else, but acknowledging it is just fundamental.
			</p>
			<p>
				Going through the lists of "What's hard for them"s, I really identify with a grab bag of traits from various styles:
				<ul>
					<li>Abstract Sequential:
						<ul>
							<li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
							<li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
							<li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
							<li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Abstract Random:
						<ul>
							<li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
							<li>Working with people who don’t seem friendly</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Concrete Random:
						<ul>
							<li>Re-doing anything once it’s done</li>
							<li>Keeping detailed records</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Concrete Sequential:
						<ul>
							<li>Working in an unorganized environment</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				The problems that have cropped up so far, or which seem likely to crop up in while working through Dev Bootcamp, are insufficient time, not monopolizing tasks when I feel I'm the one with the answer, and re-doing anything once it's done (refactoring, I see you there). I try to be diplomatic and self-aware even when monopolizing a conversation, so that's just a matter of building good collaboration-specific habits; the others feel thornier. I like to keep on a subject until I understand it as well as I'd like; I've noticed a tendency to spend a disproportionate amount of time on each week's earliest challenges until I'm in a time-crunch and have to hustle through the end of the week. And my aversion to re-doing work has lead to a lifetime of phoning in revisions. I'm both structurally- and detail-oriented, so I tend to work with a sort of "running edit" that results in a time-consuming but fairly polished first draft; that makes it hard to go back and find the things that need changing, because all the obvious ones have been changed already. Still, I think I will find it a challenge to maintain some kind of habit of revision, so that I'm not starting from square one when I start working on more complex projects that can't just be polished up on the fly.
			</p>
			<p>
				In view of all this, my personal evolution here is going to have to focus on getting more comfortable with Concrete Sequential behaviors: process, routine, and consistency. They don't come comfortably for me, so I'm going to have to strengthen those mental muscles intentionally. Things like demanding a sincere engagement with the refactoring process even when it seems trivial in the context of a given project are going to pay off for me down the line.
