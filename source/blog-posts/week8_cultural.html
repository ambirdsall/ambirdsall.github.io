				Okay, that's not a real direction, but, to be fair, the Compass of Shame is not a real compass. It may be a cop-out, but I don't feel the need to frame this post with a specific emotional conflict, because, for better or worse, I am quite consistent with how I react emotionally to conflict and feelings of shame. There's a process, and though it's evolving as I grow older (mainly, by increased comfort in talking to people in the aftermath of conflicts), the main points are the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				I find that feelings of shame manifest themselves along the North and South poles of Dr. Nathanson's compass. I tend to withdraw, primarily; I think before I speak, unto a fault, and when I'm not wholly sure of my position, whether from doubt, shame, or feelings of vulnerability, I tend to silence. My basic emotional strategy is to remove myself insofar as is possible, regroup, and reemerge. I put the onus on myself to change, if change is needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, though, the conflict is larger, less well-defined, or the sense of shame larger. I tend in these cases to ruminate for a while, and, if I can't see a way forward, try subconsciously to deal with the anxiety and shame by putting it from my mind. It never works completely, of course, but it makes it easier to put each foot in front of the other.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think my strategy has some genuine benefits. I hardly ever escalate conflicts, and I'm self-aware enough to have never yet let bottled up negative feelings explode. I do think I could do a better job of advocating for myself in the moment; but I don't think it's worth it on the whole to be less thoughtful about serious matters, which is the cause of my hesitancy in conflict. I do think that a necessary consequence of my emotional style in conflict is that I need to be aware about the type of people I surround myself with: I deal poorly with people who are emotionally over-aggressive, or who lash out.
