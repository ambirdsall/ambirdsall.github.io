				Pair coding has been a really strong point of emphasis for nearly the whole of Phase 0. Hell, I practically feel guilty for not pairing every day, even though I'm pretty comfortable with the material so far and I like to work alone. It makes sense, especially for distance learning: it forces us to develop some skills in teamwork and in articulating what we're doing while we code in parallel with actually learning to code, and it leads naturally to a sort of knowledge sharing that helps us collectively fill in the gaps in each other's understanding. It also, I suppose, gives them a heads up if someone keeps getting bad feedback that they may not be a good fit, before they've necessarily gone to the trouble of moving to a new city.

				And it's pretty satisfying, too. Every pairing session I've yet had has been open and friendly and goal-oriented; I always leave them in a good mood, typically with another challenge done. Sometimes I find my motivation waning when I'm on my own; I feel accountable to other people in a way that precludes that. And I enjoy the cognitive task of explaining things to other people, rephrasing and reformulating until they understand.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think the most consistent frustration I've run into is when, while driving, I have a clearer idea of where the code should go than my partner. I have a tendency to want to leap ahead as soon as I understand something; it's really important to me for any pairing to have genuine respect and input from everyone; and I get impatient when I think there's one answer that's logically best. Sometimes it's hard to reconcile those things. Part of the issue is that I'm wary of just taking over in a way that might come off as imperious or disrespectful, so I start second-guessing any impulse to offer to switch roles or throw out suggestions unprompted. I just kind of freeze up and try to, I don't know, use the Socratic method. I think I'll find that balance better as I get in more pair-coding reps, though.

				Feedback is a strange beast. Giving good feedback comes from paying attention and having empathy, but those can lead you to a place where you think of how someone worked as "just their style", which makes it hard to give actionable feedback. I'm not yet that consistent about giving feedback that's directed so that, were I to get it, it would give me a few things that could directly make me a better programmer. It's nice to affirm someone's strengths, but if they're smart or nice or detail-oriented or have a lot of prior experience with JavaScript, they probably know that already. It's worst when you have a really good pairing and you breeze through the work easily; sometimes it feels like the only ways to get a critique for improvement are to make stuff up, to inflate some innocuous stylistic difference to the level of an "issue", or to say "maybe be a little smarter". Which would be just the shittiest thing, and wicked unfair, too. Again, it just comes down to this: would getting this feedback direct me towards some genuine improvement in my coding practices? As if I weren't still figuring them out for myself!
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the same lines, the feedback I've gotten has mostly been nice to read, but mainly by reaffirming the connections I've made with my pairs, rather than with concrete suggestions for improvement. I think that's largely because all my partners have been at about the same place as me, in terms of experience, or even rawer. There's a part of me that would love to pair with some crusty old ninja who shows up, drops some really concise code and a few clever workflow hacks, and then disappears into the night. I almost want to be reduced to typist and syntax spellchecker, just to get a feel for what really high-level coding looks and moves like. Or maybe I'm just impatient to get into a real, physical community of people working on the same type of code I am. I have this really specific picture of a kind of osmotic observational learning that I'm not getting a lot of from google, and my pairings to date haven't quite scratched it. They're too narrowly goal-oriented and discretely defined; they're over so quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, that got existential fast. Especially given that, on the balance, I think pair coding is great and I'm looking forward to doing more of it.
