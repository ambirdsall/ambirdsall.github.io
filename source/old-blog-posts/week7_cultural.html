				It seems to me that, though several stand alone, many of the above can be lumped together into a few broader categories. One is responsibility; one is community; one is grace. More on that last one because I think that most of the rest inhere to my personal conception of it. I hew close to the first definition in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">Webster's 1913</a>:
				<blockquote>The exercise of love, kindness, mercy, favor; disposition to benefit or serve another; favor bestowed or privilege conferred.</blockquote>
				I also apply connotations of surety and mental calm; the security and control of a graceful step, of graceful climbing, generalized. I think that it is a state that is impossible to achieve without comfort in your social environment and an ability to be yourself without conscious mediation; I think it is a state that is impossible to achieve without the backstop of moral and philosophical rigor. If you live by principles, and by them you have made difficult choices, then do you get to have that kind of surety in yourself. I think I've had it before, to a greater degree than I do now. I also think that, as I get older, I'm finding it easier to get back, because I give less of a shit about cool assholes and neat stuff.

				The last two topics I've been asked advice on are cooking and music theory. I enjoy having skill and casual mastery of various things, and I guess I have been known as a smart guy. But that sort of practical, material task seems to be at odds with the metapysical bent of this prompt, so I'll delve back some. The last time I was assked for advice and judgement on something more humanistic was a month or two ago at work, when a coworker didn't know how to deal with a child who was being an asshole without losing her cool. I tried to help her get to a place where she felt she had a plan she was comfortable with, where she could calmly explain that there was no anger, but there were consequences to different choices the kid might make, and stick to her guns when the kid tried to push back.

				Being asked to pick my values, albeit in a way mediated by memories, is really interesting. I think I'd have come up with a somewhat different list if I were simply picking the most important values per se: more about work and fairness, less about people and contexts and balance and openness. I think that list would have been worse, or at least less useful, because I think that this set is a better guide for how to structure my behavior and environment. That is, I think living by this "praxis" list would do a better job of enacting my "theory" list than living by the "theory" list would.
			</p>

				And I think it's useful and important to explicitly consider values. There are many studies about how people are happier and give more to charity when they regularly attend church; though I'm an atheist, I think there's something to that: I think having a safe community to openly discuss moral and idealistic concepts is important to a person's mental health. And though, as a white man who got raised with the privilege, unmolested by society, to imagine my identity as independent of racial and social categories, I rarely encounter anything I'd identify as stereotype threat, I think that explicit reaffirmation of principles can help reinforce the individualistic conviction of one's principles. I'd hope it undermines socially mediated insecurities; that maps to my experience and intuition, anyway, and I think (and hope) it makes it easier to maintain an openness and perspective with other people, to not judge them as quickly. Today I think I've felt more comfortable in my own skin as an ethical decision maker than I did yesterday, and that is something.

				I will admit, though, when I first started this I felt a lot of exasperation and lightweight cynicism. It takes a lot of mental energy to recommit to your ideals, even just internally, and it's really easy to take potshots at an exercise this openly, cheesily earnest. But I took the night and restarted in the morning, and I'm a tiny, discrete bit better for it.
