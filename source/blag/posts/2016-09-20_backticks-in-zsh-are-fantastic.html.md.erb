## Backticks Are Fantastic
I mean, [legit awesome](http://www.refining-linux.org/archives/44/ZSH-Gem-10-Backtick-expansion/). Here, I'll demonstrate.

So, when making a symbolic link, you have to type out the absolute path to the
link target. There are, I assume, good reasons for that, but having to actually
do it kind of sucks. Two things help:

1. If, as is often the case, you want to link to go in your current directory, you can totally omit the second argument
1. Typing some shell expression inside backticks and then hitting `tab` expands that expression interactively

You could use the `$()` subshell operator with an expression and it would be
logically equivalent to backticks, but when backticks are an option, they have
two killer advantages over subshells:

1. When you fuck up, and you will fuck up, it's obvious before you run the command
1. 33% fewer keystrokes (seriously, I hate unnecessary typing)

e. fuckin' g.:

<%= image_tag('ln_backticks.gif', class: 'post-img') %>
