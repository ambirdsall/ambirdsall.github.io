<p>title: Backticks Are Fantastic Because Typing Is The Worst

<h2>Backticks Are Fantastic</h2>

<p>I mean, <a href="http://www.refining-linux.org/archives/44/ZSH-Gem-10-Backtick-expansion/">legit awesome</a>. Here, I&rsquo;ll demonstrate.</p>

<p>So, when making a symbolic link, you have to type out the absolute path to the
link target. There are, I assume, good reasons for that, but having to actually
do it kind of sucks. Two things help:</p>

<ol>
<li>If, as is often the case, you want to link to go in your current directory, you can totally omit the second argument</li>
<li>Typing some shell expression inside backticks and then hitting <code>tab</code> expands that expression interactively</li>
</ol>

<p>You could use the <code>$()</code> subshell operator with an expression and it would be
logically equivalent to backticks, but when backticks are an option, they have
two killer advantages over subshells:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you fuck up, and you will fuck up, it&rsquo;s obvious before you run the command</li>
<li>33% fewer keystrokes (seriously, I hate unnecessary typing)</li>
</ol>

<p>e. fuckin&rsquo; g.:</p>
