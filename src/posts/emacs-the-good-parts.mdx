This was originally titled "The emacs workflows that make putting up with a
mostly single-threaded text editor UI that can be slow and freeze worth it";
suffice it to say I have a love-hate relationship with emacs.

1.  you can visit that commit, of course, but let's not be so tediously thorough as to actually do it

### staging and committing

#### stage some lines visually

#### look, there in the menu: INSTANT FIXUP!

Oh, it's so good. Especially if you've done a deep dive on git, you may know
about fixup commits, but interactively choosing the commit from a lineup instead
of the whole run-commit-with-obscure-flag song and dance is a big step up in
convenience and intuitiveness.

### when it comes time to write your commit, you're in your full editor

you can split a screen, copy-paste some code from the source, etc

## dired

dired intends to replace the following shell commands directly:

- ls
- cd
- opening some file in \$EDITOR
- mkdir
- rm

See how it looks like `ls -l` output? It literally is `ls -l` output, and that's
useful: you can edit a variable to change the options passed to `ls`, if you so
desire, and you can test run your selections by running `ls -l` [<sup>1</sup>].

[1]: That's the thing about emacs: its integration with the underlying operating
system is just as deep as a shell environments', and it shares a lot of
details with one because of it. But it's different: it evolved in parallel
with the modern implementations of a shell, though unix shells are much older.
How much time you've invested learning a shell first will shape how you learn
and use emacs.

dired also has one super-power:

### wdired

This level of functionality, where you have a super mario version of a specific
mode with its own keybindings, is why you have to be down with `M-x` and looking
up commands by name to get the most out of emacs: it would be insane to have to
remember some cryptic keyboard shortcut for something so dired-specific, because
dired is just one mode out of many. To get to this level of functionality in a
sane way, the emacs tradeoff is to be willing to memorize a name or two, as with
a codebase, in order to use it. (but that's the point: emacs _is_ a codebase).
So:

#### `M-x wdired` + use autocomplete + hit enter

If you want to type out the full command like a psycho, it's `M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode`, but why would you? Of course, you have to
manually set up autocomplete, because a blank emacs install is optimized for
maintainers, not for beginners. This is a design antipattern, though I
understand the appeal.

#### make a executable file in wdired; it's just changing one character

afterward run that file with `M-!`
