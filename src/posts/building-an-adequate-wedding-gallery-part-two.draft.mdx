## Pick it up

Under the hood, the UI should be connected to a form: selecting an image means its
filename will be part of the `input_filenames` list in the processing script;
leaving it unselected means it won't. Seems straightforward enough.

For ease of use, any way it seems reasonable or intuitive to select a bunch of
different photos from a grid should work. People of all ages will be using
this: I'm trying to serve, on one hand, the parents, who in my experience tend
to take on the role of photo aggregator for their families, and on the other,
younger folks who might only be trying to grab a couple party photos quickly,
so I can't be snooty or rely on either power-user-type attempts at common
shortcuts or old-fashioned point-and-click idioms. Trying something and having
it work as you expect is great; trying something and having it not work sucks.
That means, at the very least:

1. Clicking
1. click-and-drag; and
1. keyboard navigation with arrow keys and return

should all work. I don't care yet about what sort of bookkeeping
has to happen to actually process a selected image; just about how to toggle
and display the concept of "selection" in the page. Once we've got that, THEN
we worry about what the event handlers should do besides update the UI.

## Clicking

## Click-and-drag

Not hard to find [serviceable
libraries](https://jqueryui.com/selectable/#display-grid) here, either.

## Keyboard Navigation

Okay, this is the fun one. Using the keyboard to move around means there needs
to be some concept of an "in-focus" photo: the one to be selected or from which
the user can move around the grid in any direction. That is, a
[cursor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(user_interface)>).

#### What's it look like?

Uh, I don't know. Maybe a blue outline? That's a pretty common idiom, that's
something I'd understand pretty intuitively.

The hard part is making it obvious enough to be intuitive to folks inclined
towards keyboard navigation on one hand, but subtle enough to not be
distracting to folks whose instinct is to select with the mouse. That's just an
aesthetic judgement.

#### Wouldn't a blue outline also make sense as the "selected" indicator?

Yeah, yeah. Everyone's a critic.

#### Is the cursor visible at page load?

Hmm. That might be confusing: until you start actually navigating through the
photo set, there's no context to suggest that it means "this photo is in
focus". Better wait until someone either clicks (that way you can see the
checkmark appear, too, which should make things clear when the cursor moves and
the selected image keeps a checkmark) or starts using arrow keys to move
around.

## Okay, you selected some photos. That means...?
