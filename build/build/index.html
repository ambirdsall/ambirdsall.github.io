            Please do enjoy; a more up-to-date version will have quite a different portfolio and
            feature blag posts on customized webpack builds, how to mold the git CLI to suit your
            whims, how typescript's type system is more expressive than scala's for data modeling
            but less expressive for computational side effects, emacs, observables, more emacs, how
            partially pre-filling curried functions can achieve the syntactical efficiency of
            stateful objects while retaining the testability of pure functions, and the beneficial
            effects of unit testing on software design&mdash;and maybe before too long, it will.

              A totally client-side app to parse US legal citations and
              program&shy;matically build direct links to the source document
              being cited. The project's was adopted to an institutional home
              under the aegis of Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute and
              rebranded as <a href="//law.cornell.edu/rio">RIO</a>.

              Technically, the project has been an excellent vector for
              learning about testing, build scripts, functional programming,
              and javascript transpilation. It has also provided a fascinating,
              albeit limited-scope, high-level overview of the structure of US
              law.

              As my wife and I were looking through the smugmug gallery of our
              wedding photos, the slideshow UI kept locking up. I decided
              making the photo list a doubly linked list would prevent that
              sort of memory problem, and rolled my own 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://alexandaudrey.com">gallery</a>.

              There's a rails backend that handles zipping sets of
              full-resolution photos for download. Rails isn't a perfect choice
              for such a small backend, but a) I wanted to practice testing in a
              rails environment, and b) this setup will be easier to extend
              down the line with features like tagging people and filtering the
              photo list by last or full names.

              A sudoku solver written just ten weeks after starting Dev Boot&shy;camp.
              (Okay, I dressed up the css a bit afterwards, but the logic is very much
              a reflection of me as a rank beginner.) Can solve any puzzle (that
              is possible to solve), even ones that require guessing. DOM
              interactions done with jQuery; solving logic all in vanilla ES5.

              Here's the pull request I made for API inter&shy;actions and data
              storage for an NBA stats app. The app's development was arrested
              at the proof of concept stage, once I read the small print and
              saw it unambiguously stated that outside use of the stats.nba.com
              API (at least circa when I was working on it) wasn't legal; but
              it was a good exercise in trying to write an <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapter</a>
              that isn't horrible and a thoroughly-documented PR.
